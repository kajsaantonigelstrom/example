Step 1 : Develop a Recipe

Create a Job file by hand:
line 1 : Full path to the folder where the brain data are
Line 2-n : The recipe 

From command line, go to the pipeworker folder:
cd <...>/example/pipeworker

To test the Recipe:
python pipejob.py <full path to the job file>

Step 2 : When the Recipe developed it is time to set it in production

2a : Start Pipeworkers on the servers you want to use.
Prerequisites: 
- All software needed to run the recipe must be installed on the server
- The two python scripts 'pipeworker.py' and 'pipejob.py' copied to the server
  (Copy them to the folder where you come with the ssh command)
- In the same folder as pipeworker.py, create the pipeworker.cfg file
  line 1 : Full path to the Job Folder
  line 2 : Max number of concurrent jobs for this server

2b : Start the PipeMonitor on the control computer
- Create a recipe (Function menu : Handle recipes) and copy the Recipe part of your tested job file
- Check that Job Folder and Brains Folder are correct (bottom part of the Monitor window)
- Start the jobs (Function menu : Generate jobs). In the combobox, select the Recipe you want to run and press
  Generate jobs
